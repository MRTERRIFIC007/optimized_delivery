## Overview

The Delivery Prediction System frontend provides an intuitive interface for delivery personnel to access predictions, manage orders, optimize routes, and view real-time conditions affecting deliveries in Ahmedabad. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, information-rich, and actionable, allowing users to make data-driven decisions quickly.

The application uses a responsive Bootstrap-based design with custom components for data visualization. It leverages AJAX for asynchronous data loading, Leaflet for mapping, and custom JavaScript for interactive features.
